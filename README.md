# TilesetSplitter
Tileset Splitter is a tool that was made with Microsoftâ€™s WPF UI framework for creating desktop applications. The goal is to make managing and editing sprite assets easier for use in a 2D game.
You can import a tileset that you want to split. Once the sprite size is input, a preview grid will be shown to visualize how the set will be cropped. You can also change the offset values to move the cropping area in case there is padding space on the border of the tileset. After cropping, you can select individual sprites that you want to export as separate files. You can also combine the selected sprites to a new tileset and specify the columns count.
